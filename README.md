# ECE717_FinalProject
Final Project for ECE539: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks. NMPC-Net: An efficient alternative to Nonlinear Model Predictive Control.

This project includes a Python package `NMPC_Net` which contains a nonlinear MPC for the kinematic bicycle model. It uses `pyomo` and IPOPT.
The project also includes Jupyter Notebooks that train a neural network to replicate the Nonlinear MPC.

For more details, take a look at the [Final Report](https://github.com/vifremel/ECE539_FinalProject/blob/master/docs/ECE539_ProjectFinalReport.pdf).
